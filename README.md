# Flipkart-review-scraper:
A simple scraper written in python, using BeautifulSoup to take the title and fetch all of the reviews that have been written about that book.
Attempts have been made to rely on as little structure as possible, but all scrapers are inevitably tied to the markup. Scraper works as of last commit date, but it may not work anymore.

# Overview
This is a Flask web app which fetches reviews of a particular product from Flipkart.

# Motivation
During the Coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, I started to learn Machine Learning algorithms and the mathematics used behind them. It was important to apply these algorithms to real world scenarios and deploy them.

# Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7.4. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:

'' pip install -r requirements.txt''

# Technologiew used
   - library = BeautifulSoup
   - python = 3.7
